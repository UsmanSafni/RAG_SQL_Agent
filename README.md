# RAG and Text-to-SQL Agent

This project builds a custom agent that can  query either your LlamaCloud index for RAG-based retrieval or a separate SQL query engine as a tool. In this example, we'll use PDFs of Wikipedia pages of US cities and a SQL database of their populations and states as documents.

We use:

- LlamaIndex for orchestrating the agent.
- Phoenix-arize for observability.
- Streamlit to build the UI.

A demo is shown below:

For Observability, set  setup an integration with LlamaTrace. Get an API key from [LlamaTrace](https://llamatrace.com/login) and set it in the `.env` file as follows:

```bash
PHOENIX_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> 
```

**Setup OpenAI API**:

Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and set it in the `.env` file as follows:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> 
```
